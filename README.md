# Pokedex API üöÄ

The structure of this project aims to structure the code based on components. Instead of repeating the name of the component in a folder of controllers or domain, each component is composed of its own entity, routes, controller, services, repository, test, among other files.

Each component has its providers file to avoid contact with the other files from the outside. Anyone who requires a file of its component should request it from the *.providers.ts file.

This project follows the DDD architecture and simulates the behavior of microservices.

The dependencies are managed by a container (IoC) to have a low or no coupling.
